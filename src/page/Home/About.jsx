                <p className="text-black mb-4">
                  The construction sector is the major resource-consuming, greenhouse gas-emitting, and waste-producing sector in our modern society, usingâ€”on averageâ€”more than 40% of the total raw materials extracted from the earth worldwide, contributing 11% of global emissions, and at the same time, being responsible for 50% of the world's waste, making it one of the largest sources of waste in the world.

                <p className="text-black mb-4">
                  Every year, several million tons of usable building materials end up directly in landfills throughout Rwanda. A large part of this is created in demolition and dismantling projects, but also on construction sites for new buildings, of which 10-15% of all materials are disposed of that are not used due to miscalculations before the end of their useful life.
                </p>
                <p className="text-black mb-4">
                  Accordingly, only 6% of these construction materials are recycled and reused, which means the principles of circularity are only applied in isolated instances. Transport, disposal, as well as the new production of the resulting missing building materials, create huge amounts of excess waste with huge consequences for our overall public health and the environment.

                <p className="text-black">
                  Accommodating Rwanda's rapid population growth, which is projected to increase from 13.6 million to 17.6 million by 2035, coupled with the emergence of a growing middle class and increasing urbanization, will undoubtedly drive a demand for additional buildings and infrastructure, with respective knock-on effects in terms of the volumes of waste generated, posing a pressing challenge for waste management and environmental sustainability. There is, therefore, an urgent need to transition from a linear construction model to a more sustainable and regenerative one based on circular economy principles.

            <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8">
              <p className="text-black mb-6">
                In spite of high environmental ambitions and advanced recycling technologies, we reduce entire pyramids of building materials to rubble every year, and the amount is continually increasing. For millennia, the main construction material was common sense. Every usable rock, brick or piece of timber was precious, and used and reused as long as possible.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-black mb-6">
                In today's cities, a good location has far more value than the building on it. When a building no longer fits its purpose, too often it is demolished and newly built. Investment-wise, this might make sense. But the collateral impact is huge. Most construction materials weigh heavily on the environment. Raw materials are extracted, ecosystems affected and greenhouse gases emitted throughout production and the entire logistics chain.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-black mb-6">
                Recycling only solves part of the problem. It consumes energy too, and most recycled materials have limited applications. Not all types of waste can be recycled, some of it is incinerated, while another fraction is still landfilled. And yet it doesn't have to be that way.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-black mb-6">
                Preserving and improving existing buildings is certainly the best way to go. But when this is not possible, there is another alternative to straightforward demolition. To carefully dismantle buildings that really need to go, so that their components become available for reuse not only recycling.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-black mb-6">
                The list of materials that can be fully removed and locally refurbished, is almost endless. Bricks, natural stone and timber can be salvaged from small residential buildings, while bigger office buildings can yield doors, glass partitions, sanitary equipment, tiles, metallic profiles, insulation materials, technical equipment, and more.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-black mb-6">
                Applying dismantling more widely means a larger array of second hand building components become available. And these can be reintegrated in new constructions or refurbishments. As a result, less raw materials are consumed, less waste is produced. Moreover, selective dismantling supports local economic activities and helps preserve our cultural heritage.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-black mb-8">
                Today, only 1% of all building materials are reused. Making that amount grow will require a concerted effort. ALL stakeholders within the building industry will have a role to play. Erecting buildings that contain the highest possible percentage of reused elements is "common sense", as our ancestors have proven. Making this possible again might well be the most impressive construction feat of our age. In any case, it's the way to go.
